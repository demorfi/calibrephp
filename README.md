# CalibrePHP

This is a simple [HTML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [OPDS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPDS) web server to access a database created by the [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com) application. CalibrePHP was written using [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org).

## Docker
This application is also available as a docker container. You can run this application and expose your local Calibre library into the docker container using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name calibrephp \
	-p 8888:80 \
	-v <path-to-your-calibre-library>:/library \
	openam/calibrephp
```

This will make the application available on port 8888 on the dockerhost. You can then change the `Alternate book path` setting to `/library/metadata.db` which will use the library volume provided to the container.
